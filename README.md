## JAVASCRIPT

Task was to analyze the website and find the best approach to pull the "Category List" and "Product Details".

- To get the category list I have inspected the network tab of Chrome-Dev-tool then find a API route to get all the category list at once.
- For Product Details I have gone through the website and found a script tag that holds all the website data as json data.
- I have retrieved the required data from that data and posted it to the dummy endpoint.
- I have collected the required data and some extra data for future uses.
